# Project Title

KPMG Assessment : Pressford Consulting

## Getting Started

Open the solution in Visual Studio 2017 and run the command "Update-Database" in the Package Manager Console to init the local database.

The database will be seeded with 2 users :
-Scott Pressford (Username : "scott.pressford@gmail.com" / Password : "Password2018!")
-Alan Turing (Username : "alan.turing@gmail.com" / Password : "Password2018!")

Scott Pressford is declared as a Publisher and thus can create and edit articles whereas Alan Turing is a simple reader and is not allowed
to edit or write articles. Both users have a quota of 3 likes.

The database will be seeded with 3 articles extracted from Bill Gates' blog.

### Prerequisites

You need to install AspNetCore v2.
